# WAVXO — Wrapped Auxano (Wrapped AVXO)

WAVXO is the Stellar Classic (legacy) wrapped representation of **AVXO**, the Auxano token deployed on Stellar Soroban.

Because Soroban-native tokens are not yet universally supported across all Stellar legacy wallets, exchanges, and orderbook infrastructure, WAVXO exists as the bridge asset that makes Auxano accessible on the classic Stellar network today.

## Overview

- **AVXO** is the canonical Auxano token deployed on Stellar Soroban.
- **WAVXO** is the wrapped version of AVXO issued as a Stellar Classic asset.
- WAVXO enables compatibility with:
  - Stellar legacy wallets
  - Classic DEX orderbooks
  - Exchange infrastructure that requires issuer-based assets

## 1:1 Tether

WAVXO is permanently tethered to 55B AVXO at a **1:1 ratio**:

- **1 WAVXO = 1 AVXO**

The wrapped supply is designed to mirror its Soroban supply.

---

## Supply Model

A total of:

**55,000,000,000 WAVXO**

has been issued as the wrapped counterpart to:

**55,000,000,000 AVXO**

which will be held in custody for redemption access through WAVXO.

This ensures that WAVXO represents the only public legacy-network gateway into the AVXO ecosystem during early phases.

---

## Purpose

WAVXO exists to provide:

- A stable wrapped access layer for AVXO
- Legacy Stellar network compatibility
- Exchange and DEX usability before Soroban-native listing support becomes universal

AVXO remains the root token.

WAVXO is the interface.

## Redemption (Upcoming)

Future protocol development will enable periodic redemption windows where holders may swap:

- WAVXO → AVXO (1:1)

This will make the locked 55B AVXO supply accessible only through WAVXO pathways.

Redemption logic will be implemented in upcoming ecosystem developments.
